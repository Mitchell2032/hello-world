# hello-world

My name is Mitchell, I'm 17 years old. My birthday is May 11th, and I like to work with computers. I try really hard in school because I'm a nerd lol meme.


I'm taking Mr. Bailey's class Coding 1 in order to help me get a better understanding of coding as a whole, as I plan on following a career in the technological field, more specifically systems engineering.
